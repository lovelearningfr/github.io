		<h2>Task 3</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Topic title:</b>
		<p>Elderlearn - a website aimed to help the UK elderly to learn about surveillance capitalism, big data, privacy, and security online.</p>

		<b>Brief summary of topic: </b>
		<p>Surveillance is a growing concern of internet users.
		As much as anonymity online was never really a thing
		<a href="https://codeactsineducation.wordpress.com/2019/04/30/learning-from-surveillance-capitalism/">[1]</a>,
		the recent developments in trackers,
		cookies and a range of other data-harvesting tools pose a security threat to our personal information in unauthorised hands. 
		However, even if authorised through a "Confirm all" pop-up message button, can an individual really trust the organisations whose services are being used?
		The capitalist society we live in made it quite easy for the big (and now small) tech companies to get away with selling and highly profitting off of
		personal and behavioural information collected from users in exchange for providing them with online services that nowadays seem essential to our daily
		functioning. That said, elderly people are the ones most pressured to adapt to modern, digital age of living that is much different
			to what they were used to in their youth <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8074950/">[2]</a>.
			The rapid development of technology and the legislation that follows is difficult to keep up with
			for the demographic known to be slowest to follow trends and engage with said tech. This unfortunately drives the increased feeling of loneliness
			or anxiety for them that can be omitted through providing access to tools focused on spreading awareness and understanding of the processes
			underlying the capitalistic model of online data collection
			<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-04-link-tech-anxiety-depression-older.html">[3]</a>. This project is
			aimed to help the older adults and elderly not
			only adapt to living in a digital world fuelled by a new economic order, but to educate and provide them with the resources or content neccessary to
			stay in control of tech and personal data, as well as to manage privacy in digital age.</p>

		<p><b> The material and reflections gathered/created in this week's IL task:</b></p>
	</div>

		
		<br>
		<p><h1><u><center>Week 1 - Independent Learning (IL) activity:
			<br>
			<br>Choosing and preparing your topic</center></u></h1></p>
		<br>
<br>
		<h2>Task 1 (from Week 1 IL task sheet)</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<p><li><u> Who would benefit from engaging with this topic?</u></p>

		<p>Overall, everyone who uses the internet, orders things online, browses the web and uses devices like Alexa or social media.
			This is because in order to use those services you have to accept either cookies or terms and conditions, which almost always include paragraphs
		relating to data privacy and processing. This includes a list of not only what kind of data will be collected about you through your interactions with
		the service, but also how this data is then used to provide those services and how its sold to other companies in order for them to appeal to you as well
		or to improve. This data can be anything starting from your name and home adress to what items you search for, have in your cart, or how long you
		view each product or take to type in your search.
		Therefore, the benefit for people engaging with my topic/website would be gaining awareness of this phenomenon and help them to not
		mindlessly accept all cookies because a pop-up tells them to and makes it easy to continue browsing with a "Confirm All" button. A lot of people do not
		know about how their data is being managed behind the scenes, but it's even harder to imagine for seniors who are often pressured by their grandkids
		or friends and family to use different technologies they know nothing about. As much as their grandkids may teach them for example how to use a 
		computer, they probably wouldn't mention anything about cookies, trackers, or the fact that any personal data they give out online (for example on
		messenger apps to talk to their grandkids) could
		be sold to companies they indirectly and unknowingly authorised. No one
		reads terms and conditions due to inconvenience of doing so to our personal time, so an outlet that is simple and straight-forward - like the website I am
		going to create - would spread awareness of how users fuel the exploitative economy like surveillance capitalism online. That said, as much as 
	the website will be focused on helping the elderly understand their nature of citizenship online, the website will be accessible to everyone who is willing
to learn.</p>

		<p>Another benefit from engaging with this topic would be to learn how to benefit from big data and how this surveillance we experience online on
		daily basis is not always bad. How it provides essential services to us, relevant recommendations that make browsing much easier because the
		algorithm knows what we are looking for, or the most efficient ways that we can get home from wherever on map services - without re-entering our address or
		the adresses of recent places we visited. The elderly could especially benefit from voice-operated smart technologies such as Alexa, who can set an alarm,
		order a groceries delivery, and manage the house activities like light or heating if connected to special equipment in the house.
		Therefore, the benefits of engaging with the topic I chose are broad, but there is many nuances worth discussing here. The project aims to address
		both pros and cons of how big data can influence the lives of the elderly through online services they use. </li>
<br>
		<li><u>Also think about whether your envisioned audience would be acquainted with some aspects of the topic. Are they new to the topic but eager to learn?
			Will you have to persuade them that this is worth learning?</u>

		<p>I think a lot of people "understand" cookies to a certain extent. But for the purpose of this website I am going to assume that my audience
			is completely new to the topic. There are similar websites, such as
			<a href="https://seniorsguidetocomputers.com/basics.asp">Seniors Guide to Computers</a>, but they don't talk about security online or how
			their activity is tracked and can potentially be exploited later on. My website will assume that the users already have beginner to 
			intermediate knowledge of different technologies that require internet login and that they use them in their personal lives. The website would be
			for older adults and elderly who want to learn more about security online and how to protect, but also benefit from online services at the same time.
			I think a lot of people look out for an outlet like that to help their grandparents or older family be aware and in control of their own data online,
			but my website would need marketing. With good marketing, I think a lot of users from my specific audience demographic would be interested to test it
			out and use it. Maybe even use segments of the website for workshops with the elderly willing to learn, as
			<a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/services/in-your-area/it-training/">Age UK</a> already provides similar services that are really successful. They
			cover things like scams and fraud, but don't offer a course on how various data online is harvested, processed, and sold. I think this is worth
			learning about at any age, as everyone's privacy and ability to be in charge of own peronal information matters.
			The main reason why a lot of people have no interest in learning about the processes of surveillance capitalism is because the benefits of
			accepting trackers or giving out personal information and being able to quickly access the service
			 highly outweigh the cons of declining and not being to use a certain service. But there is a way to balance this conundrum that my website aims to
			help out with in an easy, simple, and accessible format, which would make the website appealing to my audience.</p>
	<br>
		<li><u>How would the topic benefit them?</u></li>

		<p> They would know how their data is being harvested, sold, processed, and used. They could become safer online and broadened their knowledge of their
			citizenship in the digital world. This goes for everyone who uses online services that range from Maps, to social media like Facebook, to search
			engines like Google, or online markets like Amazon. All those services collect sensitive, personal information about their users that they
			sometimes use for more than users would think. Therefore the topic would benefit them because their real life habits are being used to fuel political
			economics and they are not aware of it. By being aware, they are able to not only decide about their own data and how they benefit from it, but also
			to educate others and spread the word on how to manage and protect their privacy or increase the feeling of security online.

		<p>Similarily, older people who scrutinise surveillance online can learn about how tracking interactions and presence online can limit criminal activity,
			safeguard clients, and limit liability. The activity data can be used to authenticate users, block bots, or unauthorised users, and actually
			protect our privacy.
			It's a two-sided coin and benefits to users who engage with this topic are varied too. I really liked
			<a href="https://codeactsineducation.wordpress.com/2019/04/30/learning-from-surveillance-capitalism/">this article</a> by Ben Williamson
			talking about how we learn from surveillance
			capitalism and how "policy researchers may need to start interrogating the policies encoded in the software as well as the policies inscribed
			in government texts". However, change comes from engaging with topics that are important to people and this topic gets lots of attention from 
			scholars, but not from older adults/elderly over 75 whose majority (75%) were recent internet users at the time according to the
			<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/itandinternetindustry/bulletins/internetusers/2020">Office for National Statistics</a>.
			The benefits of engaging with this topic are
			taking control and ownership of own information and maybe even inspiring other adults to get involved in encouraging governments to introduce laws
			managing things like big data more, especially data collection and the system of profitting off of it. Adapting already-existing laws and minds to
			newfound reality and recent tech developments.

		<h2>Task 2 (from Week 1 IL task sheet)</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<u>Identify what questions you want your website to answer:</u></li>

		<p><li>What is surveillance capitalism and how does it affect me?</li>
		<li>What is big data and how it is/it is not beneficial?</li>
		<li>What are cookies and trackers?</li>
		<li>How is Google, Amazon, Apple or other big tech companies harvesting/using my data?</li>
		<li>Why should I care about this if I can't decline cookies or a service is denied?</li>
		<li>What/how does the legislation for this issue work?</li>
		<li>Where can I learn more about it?</li>

		</p>
		
		<p><u>Log of the topics, search terms, prompts, questions:</u></p>
		
		Reflect and make notes on:
		<li> whether the search term returned useful and appropriate resources
		<li> why certain resource, particularly the irrelevant ones, were returned from your query </li>
		<li>whether any further refinement is needed, and then the results of these alterations</li>
		
		<br>
		<p> I used a lot of different search terms that consisted of the words "SURVEILLANCE", "CAPITALISM", "AMAZON", "GOOGLE", "CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA",
			"FACEBOOK", "ELDERLY", "UK", etc. and mixed them together using booleans like "AND", "OR" and "NOT" to distinguish from things like the Amazon forest
			or Cambridge University, as this was the main reason why the search results were not relevant.</p>
		That said, the library database and Google Scholar were especially helpful in my research at this stage. I also used the reading list we were provided with
		in 3rd year, as it had many useful books and articles regarding my topic readily available and curated by Ian Anderson, a lecturer in DMIS.
		<p>	The search output I liked specifically was Vanessa Barassi's
			<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444820913573">"Datafied times: Surveillance capitalism, data technologies and
				social construction of time in family life" </a> because it made me realise that my topic should be more specific. This academic article 
			talks about legislation in the United Kingdom and I should also focus on the UK population when talking about it. That said, it is impossible
		not to mention or talk about the United States, as many resources or authors come from there and the phonomenon of surveillance is mostly pushed
	by big companies located there. So, as much as it is inescapable to talk about some aspects coming from the US, I will talk about the UK sector. This article
	was useful for me to learn about the UK perspective, as well as the perspective of families. It bought social context to my understanding of surveillance
	capitalism and good design is focused on people who will be using my service. I will refer back to this article when designing from a social, human perspective.</p>

		<p>Personally, I think I could go forever listing my searches and topics and questions. All of them are mostly relevant and if not then it may because the
			word "cookies" doesn't only mean the tracking ones but the ones we eat. Therefore, the booleans come in handy as the
			search engine will then know I mean cookies in relation to trackers and not food. Google Scholar almost always returns appropriate academic
			and useful resources for me, but it depends how specific I am when it comes to keywords. The more specific, the better.
			However, if I was to use YouTube, it probably wouldn't be
			this way. The subject I chose is also very wildely researched, which is surprising considering how many people are unaware of how their data is being exploited.
			There's lots of resources on the topic, therefore I am not struggling for information and I will proceed to dig in deeper later on.
		<p> Additionally, in order to identify further dimesions for my project and learn what people are searching for in regards to my topic and in order
			to provide my audience with what they need, I used
			<a href="https://answerthepublic.com/reports/bef70e72-2b49-4c60-af2b-c3d2a7aa5525?recently_searched=true"> AnswerThePublic </a>. This allowed
		me to see what people search for and what questions they have regarding surveillance capitalism, as well as what concepts relate to it. So, for
		example democracy, privacy, or collective action (as seen on the second wheel). This can help me to contextualise my website and relate it to the wants and
		needs of my users, as well as real life situations, and how the system affects society as a whole, coming from individuals' perspective. I might use those
		questions and related topics users search for (visible on images below) later on when developing my website and choosing what content is most relevant
		to publish on it.</p>

	<p> I tried to specify the search for my desirable audience age group using "ELDERLY" or "OLDER ADULTS", but the results remained the same when
		it comes to AnswerThePublic. Not sure whether it was because the boolean did not work for those keywords or whether the elderly is interested in or
		affected by the same concepts.</p>
