<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of audio on the web</h2>
<br>
		<br>
<li><a href="https://mirage.place">Mirage</a> found on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/mirage">Awwwards</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/work-learning/technology-internet/internet-security/">Age UK</a> related to my topic</li>

<p><u>What is the audio used for: sound effects, ambient sound, background music, speech?
Can you find evidence of audio used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal?</u></p>

<p>Mirage is a sculpture artwork and its website is a work of art too.
The sound on the site is used for ambience, to create a suspensful, magical,
mystical atmosphere. The background music makes the webpage even more 
interesting than it would have already been. It made me intrigued about
the artist's work, which is the purpose of the site - to showcase the art.
That itself is proof of audio used with intent as it proves auditory
cues as to how the user should view the website and its content, which
improves comprehension. Similarily, the audio improves retention as I will 
definitely remember this website because of the joint usage of imagery and 
audio to present artwork, which is exceptionally successful and appealing.</p>



<p>Age UK usage of sound is completely different and yet ideal for the 
	purpose of the website. The audio is used for speech, to read out 
	instructions and content. This feature is presented with the intent of
	making the website accessible to those with impaired vision or
	mobility and especially suitable for the elderly audience who may be struggling
	to navigate the site. The feature is extremely customisable, with tons of
	settings to suit individual needs. The user can adjust colours, speed of
	audio, whether there's autoscrolling involved, click-and-listen, and many more.
	I think it's really quite impressive. The feature with so many settings that 
	can be personalised definitely enhances comprehension, appeal, and retention
	of information from the site, as all components are able to interact with each
	other to provide the most comfortable learning environment.
</p>

<p><u>What advantages and caveats of audio use can you witness?</u></p>

<p>Mirage website is visually stunning and audio present in the background
	provides an extra channel of information, conveying meaning and emotion.
	Funnily enough, because of the audio I had an impression that the art
	is based in Asia for some reason, but upon reading about the artwork I 
	learned that it's actually based on California. Furthermore, audio
	can easily get overused if browsing through the website for a while 
	plays you the same music. Luckily, there is a button to stop the sound
	to avoid cognitive overload. Also, as much as I loved the audio,
	I will probaly remember the images of the artwork and the photographs of sand samples
	it was made out of, rather than the background sound.
</p>
<p>For Age UK, the audio speech enhances accessibility and addresses different
	learning strategies, as "for example some users may learn more by
	hearing than reading a piece of text." I don't really see any
	caveats to this feature other than it can be really expensive to get it
	made and added. You also don't need to use it if you don't want/need to.
</p>



<p><u>How is audio combined with other media (images, text, video) in order to enhance a multimedia production?</u></p>

<p>For the Mirage website, the audio is related in a sense that
	encapsulates the vibe and mood that the artwork aims to bring 
	or be interpreted in. You can click through the images at your own
	pace and it doesn't influence the audio. Therefore, the audio just 
	plays in the background and is not dependent on the images. But it 
	does give them extra context overall.
</p>

<p>Age UK uses audio to read content out loud. Therefore,
	the audio directly relates to the images, as images directly relate 
	to the text that is being read out. The images used are mostly not
	photographs either, but icons and logos that represent what a chunk
	of text is talking about. For example, a tip about online pharmacies
	has a vector image of a first aid kit with a cross on it, universally
	meaning medicine, pharmacy, or hospital.

<h2>Moodboard update:</h2>

<br>

<h2>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Audio of a computer disc drive operating:</p>
<audio controls>
	<source src="master-files/sound01-computer.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  </audio>
<br>
<p>Ambient audio of a busy cafe:</p>
<audio controls>
	<source src="master-files/sound02-cafe-noise-original.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

<p>Both sounds taken from <a href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk">BBC Sound Effects</a></p>

<p>I was struggling to pick sounds that fit my topic, so I decided to go
	with the ones that most relate to it - a computer disc working and 
	a cafe chatter that might help with the feeling of exclusion or loneliness.
	I understand that this is a strech, but ideally I would use sound to 
	convert my text into speech. I would record myself reading out 
	the sample texts, but I currently have the 
	flu and can't talk, so I'm working with what I can.

<br>
<h2>Present your findings</h2>
<br>
<p>Edited sounds:</p>
<p>WAV</p>
<audio controls>
	<source src="master-files/sound01-computer-sound-trimmed-0-1.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>
<p>MP3s</p>

</audio>

<audio controls>
	<source src="master-files/sound06-cafe-noise-02.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>



<p><u>From top to bottom, left to right:</u><br>
	WAV trim in Standard (170-210 kbps) quality, Stereo<br>
	MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Joint Stereo<br>
	MP3 derivative in Standard (170-210 kbps) quality, Stereo<br>
	MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Forced export to mono<br>
MP3 of another sound I chose in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Stereo<br>
MP3 derivative of another sound I chose in Extreme (200 kbps) quality, Stereo</p>



<p>To be honest there is barely any difference between those audio files
	when it comes to sound. The only one that is noticably different is 
	the mono file (first from right). I noticed that in that one there is 
	more "background silence noice" or the ringing in the back is more clear
	and it also plays from a singular channel. That said, all samples are
	still usable. I probably wouldn't use the mono one, as the professional
	standard is stereo. Similarily, I wouldn't use the one is Extreme
	high quality because it takes more storage/space, but doesn't actually
	improve the audio quality, as it was already clear plus it doesn't matter
	that much for an ambient noice of a crowd. It could probably be useful
	for a podcast or speech or music, but not in this instance. I guess that
	means that it's worth to try to use 
	sound that is still high, usable quality, but requires a smaller file 
	size so that it can help the loading times and SEO.
