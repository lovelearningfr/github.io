	 <td>The initial idea I had for this website came from Ian Anderson
		and his ECCO lessons about surveillance capitalism. I was intrigued
		by the topic and have done a lot of <br>research on it in Year 3 of
		my studies, so I knew I can talk about it extensively.

	<tr>
		<td>Incubation</td>
	  <td>As my ideas grew, I realised that the concept is probably not
		as interesting to seniors as <br>it is to me as a DMIS student.
		That said, I still think it is an interesting read and I want to
		include the basics of it when it comes to web searching tips.
		But the focus shifted has shifted to privacy and security online
	and catering information to mature, older audiences that are looking
for resources on how to keep your private data safe.</td> 
	 
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ideation</td>
		<td>For me this was when I firstly settled for the idea of
			working with the older generations and styling the website
			in a retro web design way. I redid my whole first four weeks
			of this portfolio based on this revelation.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Evaluation</td>
	<td>I think the project is worth pursuing for many reasons.
		Older people struggle getting their grandkids to explain
		things to them and everyone should be allowed to obtain information
		themselves without relying on others. This website is meant to be
		accessible to people of all abilities, without a complicated interface.
Additionally, the unique retro styling makes it stand out and makes sure that
this actually hasn't been done before. Yes, there are organisations like Age UK
and guides as to how to use the machine that is a computer. But this styling 
idea catches attention of potential investors or even further job opportunities
for me because it combines working for the good of the community and the trending
vintage, Y2K, throwback web design that is simply popular now. I was wondering
whether I am not stereotyping with this, meaning old people = old design, but 
I think the idea actually works and is unique. My colleages think it's a good
idea as well, but I would like to improve my idea even more and make it super
focused for MAD (B), as I feel the idea is still quite broad for the time restrictions
of the course.
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr> 
		<td>Implementation</td>
		<td>As of now, I started creating the content for this proposal,
			as well as administered some basic level of CSS, but I will
			definitely develop on that later on - both for this
			proposal and for the final product. I put all of my relevant ideas
			down on this website and I will be even more selective in the
			actual web design process. I elaborated on each of the tasks
			required and presented how and why I am going to deliver
			the project in MAD (B).

  <h2>Task 2: Analyse the use of images on the web</h2>

<p>Websites I found that are relevant/similar to my topic:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.safewise.com/blog/category/senior-safety/">Safewise</a> - has a whole section dedicated to senior safety</li>
<li><a href="https://connectsafely.org/seniors/">Connectsafely</a> - has a lot of resources for seniors using the internet</li>
<br>
<p><u>What are the images used for: propaganda, advertising, click bait, aesthetics? Do they align with the website's key message(s)?</u></p>

<!-- Image container start -->
<div class="box">
	<img src="images/sc23-safe.jpg" alt="safewise.com homepage links and articles various images" height="498" style="float: left; margin: 16px;">
  </div>
  <!-- Image container end -->
	  
  <!-- Text container start -->
  <div>
	<p> The images are mostly used to make the website more visually interesting
		(aesthetics) and a little bit for advertising when it comes to 
		publications that recommend technology suitable for senior users.
		Generally though, the images represent what the articles are about.
	For example, "Best Medication Tracking Devices" article has an image of an old person's hand
	distributing tablets in daily conteiners, with pill bottles in the background.
	Using images of older individuals that look happy and active aligns perfectly with the website's purpose and its key messages
	that promote and help with navigating technologies and balanced senior lifestyles.
</p>
  </div>
  <!-- Text container end -->


<br>

<p><u>Can you find evidence of images used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal?</u></p>


	  <center><img src="images/sc24-connectsafely-1.jpg" alt="connectsafely.org homepage links and article various images" height="600">
	  </center>
	<center> <img src="images/sc25-connectsafety-2.jpg" alt="connectsafely.org homepage links and article various images" height="600"></center>

<p>Images used are releant to every article, respectfully, which enhances
	comprehension. Additionally, each photo is unique in its way, which
enhances retention. For example, a user can remember they read an article 
with an image of a person on Zoom with a forest background. In this way, it
makes them not only remember the article more, but also to find the article 
back on the website without reading descriptions. Similarily, the images
enhance the appeal of the website in general, but through including
dogs at seniors' sides in the photos, the website becomes even more appealing
and memorable to people who like animals.</p>


<p><u>What kinds of images are used? Raster, vectors, a combination?</u></p>

<p>Most of the images are pixel-based raster images (based on photographs).
	Those are a good choice for those websites, as older people can often
	feel lonely and seeing more artificial imagery they cannot connect
	with is not helpful for the audience. Real photos bring a sense of
	community and make the users feel like others engage with this content too.
	That said, Connect Safely uses some vector images as well. Surprisingly,
	I noticed that those are used for articles with negative connotations, eg.
	"Remote Support During COVID" or "Managing privacy". Both of those topics
	relate to dangers of scam, fraud, data leaks, etc, due to which we need
	information on how to prevent those. Not sure if this is intentional, but
	those kind of articles use vector images instead.

<p><u>Assess the quality of the derivative images using the subjective
	fidelity criteria and write a reflective paragraph considering
	the benefits of optimisation, the effects of different choices on
	your images and an indication of which options you believe are best
	for your project.</u></p>


<p>There are a lot of benefits to image optimisation. These include
	increased speed of loading a webpage, which makes the users more likely 
	to stay on the page, and better ranking in Google or other search engines
	using SEO. That said, different choices in editing the images have different
	effect on the final product and quality of the multimedia.
</p>
<p>Firstly, PNG images appear to be in higher detail quality that JPGs.
	This makes the user experience better, makes an impression, grabs attention, and enhances
	credibility and trust <a href="https://abmatic.ai/blog/benefits-of-high-quality-images-on-landing-pages">[1]</a>.
	That said, PNGs also come as larger size files, which doesn't benefit
	the page loading speeds or website popularity. Not everyone has the
	fastest phone or computer, so it makes them less accessible.
</p>
<p>Secondly, I edited 3 different images using different bit depths,
	resolutions, and sizes. First photo (from left to right) is in greyscale,
800px and 72ppi. Second in Indexed mode with limited 256 colours, 900px and 82ppi.
Third one is in RGB, 500px and 92ppi. At first glance, all their styles
look quite different and for a website it's very important to stay consisted.
First image is quite blurry when you zoom in, but still acceptable. I would
rate it as a passable 3. That said, I'm not a fan of greyscale and I wouldn't 
use it for my projects. Second image ended up looking overexposed and
due to being restricted in colours, multiple pixels next to each other merged
to make up for the colours lost. This makes the image look artificial,
as if make by AI. That said, the image is/looks higher resolution than 
the previous one, but for my website I want to create a sense of connection
between the site and older users and that requires using real-life pictures
that make them feel like they are not alone. Therefore, I probably wouldn't use
an image that looks this highly processed and rate it a marginable 4. 
Finally, the last image of the man on the phone is quite blurry as well because
of decreased width but increased resolution from the original, so that there is 
not enough space to actually increase any quality. That said, the image still 
looks good and I would be most likely to use that one, maybe with increased width.
I would rate it as a fine 2. It could provide high quality and enjoyable viewing.
