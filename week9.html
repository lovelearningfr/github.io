<h2>Task 1: Analyse the use of video on the web</h2>
<br>
		<br>
<li><a href="https://amycurrell.com">Amy Currell</a> portfolio website found on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/amy-currell">Awwwards</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/work-learning/technology-internet/internet-security/">Age UK</a> related to my topic</li>
</li>

<p><u>What are the videos used for?
Can you find evidence of video used with intent, which enhances
information comprehension, retention and appeal?</u></p>

<p>Amy Currell's photography portfolio incorporates images, animations, sound, and 
	videos that she made herself in order to showcase them to the public
	and potential employers. All the photography was made with an intent to
	promote various brands or products. However, the way they are presented on
	the site enhances the appeal not only of the products themselves, but 
	of Amy's skills as a professional photographer. The job often depends on
	how you can promote and create art youself, so that it is enticing and of
	high quality. This website enhances the user's comprehension of Amy's abilities
	and because of the unique design, where photos follow cursor movements or 
	enable the user to pause or mute the videos without visible buttons helps
	with memorising the experience. 
</p>

<p>At the homepage, the images and videos are connected into a video loop
	that skips between into different projects you can read more about.
</p>
<center><p><img src="images/sc34-website-analysis-2.jpg" alt="homepage video animation for a photography portfolio display" height="500"></p></center>

<p>On the main page, there is also an animation that unveils photos as you move
the cursor across the screen.</p>

<p>Age UK uses video to share essential tips on using the internet as a
	senior or to share the experience of other people that age managing
	their technology use. In this way, the videos are used with the intent
	of making the content seem not so foreign or scary and show users 
	that other individuals their age benefit from technology use and you 
	can to, if you are willing to learn. It makes the connection to users less
	artificial and more related to real-life needs of seniors. Additionally,
	those videos make the content more accessible and enhance retantion
	for people who learn better watching and listening to a video rather than
	reading static words/information. 
</p>
<center><p><img src="images/sc35-website-analysis-3.jpg" alt="video of an older woman explaining the benefits she gets while using technology" height="600"></p></center>

<p><u>What benefits and caveats of video use can you witness?</u></p>

<p>When it comes to Amy's website, it benefits from being a highly visual
	medium with minimal text due to her craft of telling stories through images.
	Luckily for her, "viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it
	in a video compared to 10% when reading it in text" <a href="https://www.popvideo.com/blog/looking-at-the-facts-why-video-content-has-the-highest-retention-rate">[1]</a>. 
	That said, the film and photography scene is oversaturated with images and 
	different techniques of presenting artistic work, so a recruiter who views 
	those all the time might not react to this portfolio the same as someone 
	who has no knowledge of the industry. However, Amy's website benefits from 
	intrinsic multimodality that combines video, audio, and animation to 
	present the overall product. This allowed her for the flexibility of expression
	in developing a website that she wants to be associated with, which in turn
	affects how people perveice her and her work. It is said that images convey a thousand words,
so the website will definitely appeal to those who are visual learners.
That said, not everyone may like that there are no contextualising statements 
next to each project or the chaotic layout of the website with no clear clickable areas.
</p>
<p>Age UK definitely aimed to improve the user's retention while posting those 
	informative YouTube videos. Those help to accomodate not only different 
	learning styles, but also give a kind face to an obstacle that the website
	aims to help with. It makes the viewers feel less lonely if they are 
	struggling to use technology at their age and shows them that anyone can do it.
	The videos are encouraging and informative. Due to keeping the videos up to
	3 minutes, they catch attention and feel worth watching even for those 
	with a short attention span. The videos are not present on every page or
	overused, instead they are only added if appropriate, to enrich the 
	experience of users with general topics and general information like "how 
	to make the most of of internet". I don't see any caveats with the use 
	of videos here, I think it's important that older people see themselves
	represented as capable and video interviews humanise the experience of 
	learning at an old age. It is not emabarrassing, it's helpful!
</p>


<p><u>How is video combined with other media (images, text, audio) in order to synthesise a multimedia production?</u></p>

<p>Age UK is heavily text based, as an educational resource. Occasionally,
	it adds videos and images of older individuals, as intended audience
	members, and icons representing what the text is about. This makes is easier
	for the users to navigate the website and finding the content that they 
	need without having to read everything.
</p>

<p>Amy's portfolio is much more sophisticated as a multimedia production.
	It combines her images and videos in various arrangements at different
	parts of the website. The videos are snippets from commercials or
	campaigns and are combined with photographs to follow a mouse cursor,
	play full screen, create a pattern with the use of white space, or serve
	as a part of an animation on loop. All together it creates a quite 
	artistic effect, however the website is probably not the most accessible due 
	to the lack of features that support different disabilities.

  </video>
</center>

<p>From left to right: 1080p, 720p, 480p (bottom).</p>

<p>Video is a great way to enrich a digital environment. In my video 
	I decided to state simple facts and findings related to the benefits 
	of using technology for seniors. The video is short and conveys the point
	I am trying to make using visual queues of older people using technology 
	and text that contextualises the image, as well as the purpose of my site.
	That said, in such a short period of time it is impossible to convey 
	everything, especially in a way that text can. Also, we have to be considerate
	of different individual's reading speeds and accessibility. This is why 
	I elongates the times of words on screen, as well as chose black/white 
	combination for text and background for highest contrast, even if 
	the whole video is not black and white. I think such videos enable 
	people to learn quickly about the gist of text/article without needing
	to read everything on the page. It delivers the main message and makes
	the website more interesting and ensures multimodality.
</p>
<p>Of course, the 1080p video is of the highest quality, but 720p doesn not
	look much worse. I would probably avoid using 480p, as the image is not clear 
	and doesn't promote a good user experience. That said, I would opt for 
	720p videos on my site, as they deliver quality of image and require
	less storage than 1080p, which increases website loading speeds and
	boosts SEO.
