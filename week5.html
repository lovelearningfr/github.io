<h2>Task 2: Evaluate resources</h2>
<br>
		<p><a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk">Age UK</a> is a website that
		relies heavily on text and conveying of information, but does
	it in a well-crafted web writing manner that is senior friendly.</p>
	
	<p><u>Evaluate your chosen website against the fourteen professional writing characteristics.</u></p>
 
	<li><b>Accuracy</b>: Is the text accurate, authoritative and any arguments backed by evidence?</li>
	
<p>Yes, the website is very accurate. I wasn't able to explore all of it because it's 
	very vast and covers basically all aspects of senior living, but I focused
on the IT part as per my topic. The website doesn't often refer to external sources
when it comes to it's arguments,
it just explains different aspects and definitions of things you may encounter
while engaging with technology and the digital world. As to my knowledge,
they are all accurate (the ones I read) and explain in simple terms what an email, Apple device,
or software, etc. is. The style of writing is concise and straight to the point
without detailed descriptions. Sometimes the website recommends things like
anti-virus software and refers to other companies' websites like Microsoft, etc.
It doesn't really explain why those specific ones are included, it just 
shares resources. But they are all quite good.</p>

<li><b>Active voice</b>: is it used correctly or excessively?</li>

<p>The whole website is written in an active voice, mostly using "you"
	and encouraging users to get engaged and offering solutions to their
	frustrations. I don't think it's excessive, it's appropriate for the 
	purpose of the site and addressing user personally, so that it feels like
	they are in control.
</p>


<li><b>Bias</b>: any biases and stereotypes evident in the text?</li>

<p>I haven't noticed any biases present on the website. They don't use any
	pronouns, which makes the text genderless and avoids bias. The website
	doesn't patronise the users and encourages them to do things at their
	own pace and their own way while offering instructions.
</p>

<li><b>Clarity</b>: jargon and technical terminology defined?</li>

<p>The website has a full glossary section for technical terminology related
	to the digital technologies mentioned on the website. In the definitions present,
	the writers use simpler words that the audience will understand in order
	to explain a term or a gadget or a service and get the readers a gist
	of what they are reading about without going into details. Here are some
	examples of simple definitions:
</p>

<p><center><img src="images/sc16-glossary.jpg" alt="glossary of terms at ageuk.org.uk" height="510"></center></p>

<li><b>Conciseness</b>: are the paragraphs wordy?</li>

<p>The website has a lot of useful information on it. To be honest, it seems 
	a bit overwhelming to me at first because there's so many links and tabs.
	However, the way the website tackles that is by splitting content into 
	small, very specific chunks on different pages. The wordiness of the website
	comes more from the volume of information, not really the way things
	are worded, as everything is quite straight forward. 
</p>

<li><b>Conversational and Smoothly Flowing Prose</b>: does it use plain language and contractions?</li>

<p>The website avoids complex or convoluted sentences and opts of simple,
	easy sentences. Where appropriate, the writers use contractions like
	"If you'd like to shop with us..." instead of going for the longer option.
</p>

<li><b>Correctness</b>: does it have poor grammar or words used incorrectly?</li>

<p>No. The website is a part of a larger, professional organisation and 
	is maintained regularly by many people taking care of its different design aspects.
	The grammar is perfect and all the words are used correctly and in appropriate
	context.
</p>

<li><b>Parrallelism</b>: does it appeal to our natural desire for symmetry?</li>

<p>I haven't noticed this website using that technique. This may be because it
	is not trying to directly sell something, as much as it is an educational
	resource. Instead, it uses simple sentances/statements to convey a point. For example:
	"Get a free weekly friendship call. We'll match you with one of our
	volunteers. Our service is flexible to suit the different needs
	of everyone who takes part." That itself, has a level of symmetry to it.
</p>

<li><b>Positive voice</b>: does it use downbeat words or words that have a negative connotation?</li>

<p>It uses positive voice to address the user at all times. The negative
	connotations are only used for negative things like scams and fraud and 
	the technology aiding those like spyware.
</p>

<li><b>Strong nouns and verbs</b>: does it overuse verbs or does it make
them do the hard work?</li>

<p>No, it doesn't overuse them. The website uses positive, encouraging phrases like
	"Youâ€™re never too old to learn something new. There are
	lots of classes and courses out there where you can improve
	specific skills or learn something new, many of which are free of charge."
</p>

<li><b>Sentence Variety</b>: does it avoid sentences beginning with the same word and use a variety of sentence lengths?</li>

<p>The website combines short, medium, and long sentences. The sentences themselves
	are varied and used to constantly propel/develop a narrative with each step; explaining
	what happens next or how to use certain technologies. They never begin with
	the same word or phrase from what I've seen.
</p>

<li><b>Simple words</b>: does it use more recognisable words over showy words?</li>

<p>The website uses simple words in order to explain the purpose of each tab.
	However, it does use further explanations a lot and repeats things on
	different tabs. For example: "Email is electronic mail". That said, 
	this is what the website is meant to do. Explain different technologies and
	online services, as well as elaborate on what they do and how to use them.
	So sometimes, the website uses longer phrases to explain simple concepts.
</p>

<li><b>Shorter paragraphs</b>: does it keep to 8 lines max for web paragraphs?</li>

<p>Yes, the division of content is exceptional on this website. Long explanations
for different services or technologies are divided into paragraphs or elaborated on
in more detail in different pages/tabs using links. In this way the user is able to
decide how deep they want to get into each topic, as the level of information
progresses. Additionally, it enables to skim through the content 
faster, so that the user is not intimidated by the amount of information given.</p>

<li><b>Tone and voice</b>: is the writing attitude appropriate for intended audience and purpose of the website?</li>

<p>Yes, the tone is professional and focuses on personal encouragement of
	the audience to keep learning and reach out. The website doesn't patronise the 
	people willing to learn about the digital word and instead offers a helping hand
	and resources to keep going that make the users feel less isolated and confused.
	The writers explain everything in a step-by-step approach that is easy to follow
	and helpful for people getting started with using online services and more.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Task 3: The Awe writing process</h2>
<br>

<p>I fully completed the "Define audience" and "Define purpose" steps of the "Assess" stage
	of the AWE writing process. This has been fully exhibited in the previous weeks
	of this portfolio. Having described and analysed the desired audience 
	characteristics and what language I am going to use, as well as investigated
	the design features of two websites and the professional writing
	characteristics of the one related to my subject, I feel fairly confident
	to discuss and write about it further. Additionally, having developed local (UK) profiles
	and peronas, as well as scenarios for my users, I successfuly identified the
	educational and informing purpose of the site to develop. It took me a while
	to come to the choice of styling my website in a retro manner. However, this
	decision makes me feel confident in designing a minimalistic interface
	that will be perfect for my audience to navigate, as well as set me apart 
	from the competition due to an obscure look that grabs attention and helps
	the users remember their visit. I also conducted some research to an extent,
	basing my choices on academic articles and journals I found online about
	design, usability, and accessibility, so that noting in my design is
	accidental and instead carefully planned. I am going to finish up
	the "Organise, categorise & outline" stage now.

<p><h1><u><center>Week 5: Adapting textual content to your <br><br>design needs</center></u></h1></p>
<br>

<h2>Task 1: Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content</h2>
<br>
<br>
The webiste used: <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk">Age UK</a>
<p><center><img src="images/sc17-voyant-results.jpg" alt="voyant corpus tool results using ageuk.org.uk" height="550"></center></p>

<p><u>Compare and write up the findings you have taken
	from this tool with those you extracted using the professional writing
	characteristics.</u></p>

<li>high frequency words from the word cloud: <b>age, advise, information, services, uk, support, care</b></li>
<br>
<li>the trends and bubblelines analysis:</li>
	
<p>- the word "information" is prevalent in segment 1 & 2,
	perhaps because it initially introduces the educational purpose
	of the website; it aims to establish context right as users enter the site
	and quickly disappears with limited mentions in sections 5, 6, and 9</p>

	
<p>- "service" remains quite consistently present thoughout the website, creating
U-shaped bells on the graphs in sections 2, 5, 6, 8, and 10; it drops and then
reappears, supposedly reminding the users that they can always reach out for help
and that the support services are available</p>

<p>- "age" is the most frequent word that appears on the website; it starts off with
a relative frequency of 0.001 in section 1 and fully drops for three sections to
then drastically rise in section 5 and keep rising till another drop in section
8 and achieve its highest frequency in section 10, at the bottom of the site; i think
this relates to the website initially staying open for anyone to visit, but then
getting more and more age and content specific as you explore</p>

<p>- similarily the word "uk" doesn't appear until the main body of the 'text'
	and stays present throughout until the end; again, i think the website
	states general purpose and introduces the topics it aims to help with
	and then gets more specific with content that is affected by age and
	geographical location; the services in the uk are unique to the country and 
	the culture - the website needs to address those user needs
</p>

<p>- "care" is the most interesting trend because it is the most frequent
	word on the website that starts to drastically
	rise in section 3, peaks above all other words in section 4, then drastically
	drops to 0 in section five; after that, it comes back in the later sections
	in very small amounts (smaller frequency than all the other words);
	i think this is because all the information about finding and arranging 
	social care is put towads the beginning of the website, so that users
	who are specifically looking to care for a loved one don't have to
	read through the whole website and get help immediately
</p>

<p>Bubbleline example of "care":</p>
<p><center><img src="images/sc18-bubbleline-voyant-2.jpg" alt="voyant corpus tool bubbleline results for the word 'care' using ageuk.org.uk" height="300"></center></p>

<p>Bubbleline for all the 'trend' words:</p>

<p><center><img src="images/sc19-bubbleline-voyant-3.jpg" alt="voyant corpus tool bubbleline results for all the trend words using ageuk.org.uk" height="300"></center></p>

<p>Separate bubblelines for each of the 'trend' words:</p>

<p><center><img src="images/sc20-bubbleline-voyant-4.jpg" alt="voyant corpus tool separate bubblelines results for all the trend words using ageuk.org.uk" height="300"></center></p>

<p>Bubblelines are a great tool to see exactly in which section each word
	was used and to what extent. The bigger the bubble, the higher
	the frequency. In this way, we gain yet another way to visualise data.
</p>

<p>In comparison, those findings highly relate to those extrated using the
	professional writing characteristics. The trending words are the same
	as analysed above. The focus on age is crucial to writing for the desired
	audience in a way that reflects not only their abilities, but also their
	lifestyle and interests. I believe that because I uploaded a general
	homepage link to Voyant, the frequent phrases are more broad. This is
	the major differece between the two analysis techniques. In the professional
	writing characteristics exercises I focused specifically on the tabs or
	sections of the website that talked about privacy and security online 
	for seniors. If I linked a glossary page or technical instructions page,
	the words would probably be more specified. However, it is impossible to talk
	about Age UK, or my website for that matter, without addressing the lifestyles
	and other needs (apart from the digital ones) of my users. Therefore, I stuck
	
	to analysing the broad aspect of the website to gain inpirations for my own.
	The similarities between the findings include the professional, simple
	language and terms I found, as well as the focus on providing advice and
	care to the elderly. Both encapsulate the educational purpose of the website.
	Voyant additionally helped me to see where specific terminology is important to
	include, while looking at the overall product. Using bubblelines and the
	trends graph might help me later in designing my website when distributing
	content based on other successful projects that deal with my topic. In 
	this instance, the information inferred from Voyant and professional
	writing characteristics would advise me to focus on the general idea,
	context, and introductions on the homepage, put care and reach out links
	around the top of the page, and work deeper into UK-specific resources and
	information the more detailed the main body gets.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Task 2: Create Samples of text</h2>

<p><u>Select 2 key points in your narrative and write a sample paragraph for each.</u></p>

<p><b>Example text:</b></p>

<p1>"Surveillance is a growing concern of internet users. As much as
anonymity online was never really a thing, the recent developments
in trackers, cookies, and a range of other data-harvesting tools pose
a security threat to our personal information in unauthorised hands.
However, even if authorised through a "Confirm all" pop-up message button,
can an individual really trust the organisations whose services are being
used? The capitalist society we live in made it quite easy for the big
(and now small) tech companies to get away with selling and highly
profitting off of personal and behavioural information collected from users
in exchange for providing them with online services that nowadays seem
essential to our daily functioning. Why should you care about this?
Do you know how your data is being harvested,
sold, and passed on through different channels? This section
will serve as your guide into what's going on behind the scenes of big tech
companies like Facebook or Google. If you feel uncertain about giving
out your personal information online, you have the right to withdraw consent
and take charge of your personal information.
Read more and learn how [link]."</p1>

<p>This is a sample text that could be an introduction into a specific
	part of the website dealing with trackers and cookies and web browsing.
	I think it could still be shortened or divided into chunks later on, but it's just an example
	for now. I think it uses simple phrases of various lengths, authorative and active
	voice, as well as varied sentence starters. Having done the previous two
	writing expercises I think I should focus more about the positive tone and 
	attitude towards those technologies and mention more about the benefits
	of using them. The paragraph would benefit from more uplifting words and 
	a call to action earlier on. I think the terminology should also further be
	explain, but I can manage that by adding a glossary section and referring
	to that whenever needed. That said, I though about not including this section in 
	my website at all, but I think it's unfair to my audience to not mention anything
	about this phenomenon and allow them to blissfully agree to sharing all their
	data with third-party companies because the use of those services brings them
	some benefit - especially when you can just decline, while getting all the benefits.
	That said, I will come back to re-writing this paragraph in a more positive
	tone later.
</p>

<p><b>Example text:</b></p>

<p1>"Social networking sites like Facebook help you stay
connected with family and friends, follow public figures, and
meet like-minded people. That said, it's still crucial to control your
privacy settings,
restricting access to personal information and refraining from sharing
personal details like your phone number or address."</p1>

<p>I think this is a simple and effective way of presenting a
	key argument and calling the users to action/giving useful instructions.
	It uses very simple words, it's not wordy, and the tone is positive.
	The paragraph lets the verbs do the hard work and it encapsulates the 
	purpose of the website without going into specifics.
</p>

<p>I discussed those samples with my boyfriend's mother, as she is a native speaker
	from Scotland
	and a senior University professor. She liked both and thought the content was 
	interesting, but advised me to limit down the word count and keep
	it as concise and straight to the point as possible when it comes to 
	content introductions.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Task 3: Update your moodboard and your website</h2>

<p>I have two types of moodboards for this website. For the visual aspects
	like layout, typography, colors, styles, etc. I use
	<a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk">Pinterest</a> and
	for task or text-specific elements I use different post-it boards on
	<a href="https://miro.com/app/dashboard/">Miro</a>. You can see
	snippets of both below.
