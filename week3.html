		<h3>Task 1 & 2 (from Week 3 IL task sheet)</h3>
	
<u>Identify key narrative points and create a plan & Incorporate the narrative plan into your portfolio</u>
<br>
<br>
<p><li><b>What do you want your audience to take away from your website? This isn't just about conveying information!
	It is about outcomes (e.g. skills, experience, ability, new way of doing things). What will your website help them do?</b></li></p>

<p>The website is aimed to promote safe web practices and encourage people to pay attention to who they are giving out their peronal information
	to and to what tracking or data colletion about them they are agreeing to. The website should help them in navigating the terms and services in an
	effective way and inform about cookies and behavioural tracking done for online services on daily basis. The users ideally would be able to take quizzes
	and earn badges for answering correctly, which would encourage them to learn more. Therefore, they would gain knowledge, experience, and skills to stay
	safe online according to their wants and needs.</p>
<br>
	<p>For this exercise I'm going to use the framework from the further reading of the
		<a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/storytelling"> Interaction Design Foundation</a>.
		The checklist is based on the "Aristotle's formula for what stories should contain,
		since he wrote extensively on storytelling".
	</p>

	<li><u>Plot</u> - What are users trying to achieve/overcome?</li>
	
	<p>My users are trying to overcome the stigma of "older people are only interested in knitting", as if
		they are incapable of learning anything new at their age, which is not true. At the same time they are
		trying to adapt to the demands of the digital world and the pressure from not only their families to use
		the internet whether to communicate or use medical/home services, but from the evolving society that moved
		on to completing many daily tasks online. Those challenges then come with another challenge of staying safe
		on the web and looking out for scams or exploitation of personal information from big companies or any services
		one may use. I'd say my users are trying to achieve a balance between keeping an appropriate amount of
		privacy online and benefiting from the use of technology. Benefits include mental stimulation (which reduces
		the risk of dementia), reduced isolation, health monitoring, and increased independence according to
		<a href="https://communitytechnetwork.org/blog/benefits-of-technology-for-older-adults/"> Community Tech Network</a>.
		And that's what I believe my users are trying to really achieve.
	</p>

	<li><u>Character</u> - Who are the users: not just demographically,
		but what insights do you need to understand what they
		(and their needs) are truly like?</li>

		<p>My users are UK seniors (60+). As established in pervious weeks, I understand that
			their needs and speeds of processing visual information may be different form those that are younger.
			Also, having read a
			<a href="https://www.onlinecentresnetwork.org/sites/default/files/a6_your_guide_to_helping_older_people_use_the_internet.pdf"> Guide to helping older people use the internet</a>
			I might consider using an even simpler language in order to explain not only the phenomenon
			at hand, but also elements like "picture" instead of "icon". This is because I want this website to be available to as many older
			adults as possible, not only those who are already comfortable with using their computer. Maybe I can use professional language
			and then include simpler explanations in brackets when needed. That said, the main audience profile does
			assume some previous knowledge/use of online services. My audience is people who are eager to learn more, which of course not everyone is.
			Please read about the full accessibility considerations and how the design aims to tackle them in the
			<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="#nextquestion">question below</a>.
		</p>

		<li><u>Theme</u> - How can you establish a trustworthy presence to them?
			How will you reflect the overall obstacles users must overcome?</li>

<p>Using professional language and referring my users to other more established sources to confirm my information (like government sites).
Highlighting the benefits, as well as challenges that come with using modern technologies, so that
users can decide themselves what they think/want to do. Not deciding for them, just stating facts and statistics.
Focusing on things my audience can do about managing their privacy and security online and assure them that they are
in charge. Making sure that they understand all information and implications by using simple language and sharing examples.
Avoiding timeouts at all tabs and allowing time for users to process all information at their own pace.
</p>

<li><u>Dialogue/Diction</u> - What will your design say to users, and how? Does a formal/informal tone match their expectations? How much text is appropriate?</li>

<p>My design should be simple, with effective use of white space and big gaps between
	links or paragraphs, as well as clickable areas. Those will be especially
	visible and highlighted when hovered over with a cursor. The colours will be chosen
	with the help of
	<a href="https://venngage.com/tools/accessible-color-palette-generator"> Accessible colour palette generator</a>, which can help
	me to easily follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
	Hopefully in this way, the design will be friendly to my intented audience.
	The formal tone will match their expectation so that they know that this is a trustworthy source.
	I will try to separate information based on topic and only convey the most relevant bits 
	that I want my audience to learn. Definitely will limit or separate text so that it's not
	overwhelming using a step-at-a-time approach.
</p>

<li><u>Melody</u> - How will the overall design pattern appear pleasant and predictable to users?</li>

<p>The design will follow constant, predictable patterns. The colours I'm
	planning to use are blue, navy, white, and black. "According to
	<a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2016/11/07/cool-or-just-common-blue-is-the-webs-most-popular-color"> Gage Salzano</a>,
	senior designer at creative studio Nelson Cash, blue speaks to safety, professionalism, and security. With the color blue, there are no surprises to be had."
	Therefore, it's a perfect colour for the site for seniors and for my topic.
	Blue and navy will provide contrast on a white page, as well as
	make it more interesting and pleasant to look at than just black and white.
	It is the most popular colour for a reason.
	"<a href="https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/web-design-principles">Consistency</a>
	of functional design (UI controls) and visual design
	(colours, typefaces, styles) will make my website more predictable
	for visitors and improve the overall usability."</p>

	<li><u>DÃ©cor</u> - How will you present everything so the graphics match the setting the users can sense? Would a classic design or stylized, niche layout meet their expectations?</li>

<p>Classic design. Usability is the most important for me because my audience
has specific needs that need to be seen to. Too much styling and inaccessible fonts
are unnecessary and inapropriate for the demographic given. They will be replaced
by simplistic design with large font and toned colours with high contrast and
obvious clickable/selectable areas (highlighted or underlined).</p>

<br>
<section id="nextquestion"></section>
		<p><li><b>Write a reflective statement considering how the chosen narrative points combine to create an overarching story
			and how your design considerations to date might interact with this.</b></li></p>

<p>There are a lot of accessibility considerations to have in mind. Vision changes with age and it is important for my design to be
	legible and clutter-free so that my audience demographic can manage the website easily. I realised I should avoid using too much colour
	due to the differences in perceiving colour and opt for those higher in contrast. Due to the decrease in processing visual info quickly
	I should emphasise areas that are clickable and avoid any timeouts to allow users lots of time to complete forms or tasks available on my
	website. A large group of older people struggles with motor control, so leaving large gaps between elements on page and minimising keyboard
	use is important to me. All tables will be coded-in and selectable so that the website can be used and readable with assistive technologies,
	eg. a screen reader or braille display. That said, the narrative of my website would be that it's never too late to learn or ask for help
	and that there are outlets that allow you to do and understand more than just how to send an email.

		<a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/considerations-for-designing-websites-older-people"> Alzheimer's Society</a>
	</p>
	
		<p>My story can begin from the history of how surveillance capitalism came to power when it comes to web developments
		and the social setting changes. It wouldn't be mandatory to look at it, but it should be an option to go through a sort of time capsule
		filled with images and minimal smooth transitions/animations. It could even go into different theories like technological determinism or social
		construction of technology, which are topics that combine sociology, philosophy and the history of the Internet - enabling the learning process
		to be objective and broad. As much as this sounds overwhelming at first, a significant division of content will make this easier to process.
		Therefore, I would like to employ chronological and thematic structure of my website. The level of knowledge would grow accordingly
		from a complete beginner to more advanced, so that you can choose specific topic that interest you and do not have to read things you
		do not understand or care for.</p>
