<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>I am using CSS when it comes to adapting the colours of specific
			elements across the website to make it consistent across. I'm also
			adapting the space in which I want all content to lie within 
			through restricting the "body" space. In this way, I am able to
			use the white space on each side, which helps to increase
			readability and reduce visual clutter
			<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Constantinos-Coursaris/publication/269639066_Web_Aesthetics_and_Usability/links/565cbb5b08ae4988a7bb8090/Web-Aesthetics-and-Usability.pdf">[1]</a>.
		This is important because in our day to day lives we experience more information
		getting thrown at us than ever, which can lead to information overload.
		"Information overload is a problem that is being exacerbated by
		the ongoing digitalization of the world of work and the growing use
		of information and communication technologies
		<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10322198/">[2]</a>."
		Thinking about my audience, it's the last thing I want to happen to them
		when interacting with my website. Here are some visual examples I found on
		<a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/104705/why-do-many-sites-leave-half-of-each-webpage-empty">Stack Exchange</a>
		of why using white space on the sides is important and effective:</p>
<br>
		<li>No use of white space; clutter; doesn't encourage the user to read
			more; overwhelming
		</li>
		<p><center><img src="images/img08-stack-exchange.jpg" alt="website with minimal white space" height="480"></center></p>
		<br>
		<li>Uneven; looks odd; poor distribution</li>
	
		<p><center><img src="images/img09-stack-exchange-2.jpg" alt="website with ineffective white space" height="480"></center></p>
		<p><center><img src="images/img10-stack-exchange-3.jpg" alt="website with ineffective white space" height="480"></center></p>
		<p><center><img src="images/img11-stack-exchange-4.jpg" alt="website with ineffective white space" height="480"></center></p>
	
	<li>Centered; efficient for all screens; catches the eye</li>

	<p><center><img src="images/img12-stack-exchange-5.jpg" alt="centered website with effective white space" height="480"></center></p>
		
	<p>According to <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/improving-usability-with-fitts-law/">Web FX</a>,
	and Fitts's law, "the bigger an object and the closer it is to us, the easier it is to move to."
Therefore, centering my design through the use of white space at both sides
of the screen has a special meaning to my elderly users who may differ in their 
motor control abilities. "When web layout is located at the center
of the screen, the user can interact with the browser software and
operating system much more efficiently," as all information and links or menus
stay within a limited area which minimises cursor movement distance.</p>

<p>Additionally, upon researching further into how I want my design to actually
	look like, I came across retro websites t9hat inspired me. I decided I want
	to utilise a "retro" look for my website, as it is minimalistic and simple
	to use/explore. This would not only look interesting, but set my website
	aside from all other websites directed at the elderly available at the market.
Websites that I explored are <a href="https://non-os.webflow.io">Non Os</a> and some
websites I found though the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001205055600/http://geocities.yahoo.com:80/home">Wayback Machine</a>, like Geocities.</p>

<p><center><img src="images/sc14-geocities.jpg" alt="archival geocities website" height="480"></center></p>
<p><center><img src="images/sc15-non-os.jpg" alt="non on website" height="480"></center></p>

<p>Those two designs are very different, but they both have an old-timey
feel to their interface and they both primarily utilise the center of the screen.
I do not want to copy those designs, but rather use CSS to create something
in the middle, that encapsulates an old, simple interface, but take it
clutter-free and bring a modern twist on it, while sticking to the theme.
</p>

<p>In order to do that, I will use CSS to format all my website's font to Helvetica,
	which is the most popular font in the world. "Older adults and people
	with low vision have less difficulty processing type faces like Arial
	or Helvetica. Without the serifs, itâ€™s easier to recognize characters
	<a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/designing-for-senior-citizens-organizing-your-work-schedule.php">[3]</a>."
In my eyes, the font also contributes to a sort of retro look on the site,
having enlarged it quite a bit for my audience.
</p>

<p>On top of that, because the letters have been enlarged, I adjusted
	the space between the lines in all paragraphs, so that the text is easier
	and faster to read. 
</p>
<p>CSS is helpful in managing the links settings and the way users
	can interact with them. For my website, once hovered over the links
	turn into darker navy blue and their underline disappears so that the user can clearly tell that 
	this is a selectable element. Additionally, when interacting with the
	active link, the background changes to pink. This informs the user that 
	the link is currently being used. 
</p>
<p>I'm also using the in line feature to put elements next to each other
	in one line and style tables so that they are readable and selectable.
</p>
<p>Of course, there's many more uses of CSS than those,
	but these are important for my website now.
